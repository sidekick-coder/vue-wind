Vue components using tailwind styles

[Documentation](https://vue-wind.sidekick-coder.com) - [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Introduction


Every project will have the same common components like buttons, inputs, cards, etc..

This lib have the objective to speed up the process of creating the same components for every project using tailwind css styles.

One of the goas is to have a very high level of customization and integration with **tailwindcss**, so the lib do not came with tailwind styles by default.

The components are **raw vue files** with static classes without any css, this is because they are builded thinking in the tailwind purge system, so the css will be injected by tailwind itself.

Also the components are not builded by default, the reason for this is to have a compatibility with [nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) and be able to generate ts types of each component using **nuxt components dirs feature**
